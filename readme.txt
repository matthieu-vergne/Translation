PURPOSE

This project aims at building some translation tools to help translators.

HOW TO

This project was initially made for a dedicated translation project but
is going under a generalization task. Although it provides an editor,
this editor cannot be used without providing some additional code, so
this project is for the moment a set of libraries to use in dedicated
translation projects.
